## Co-op Work Experiences

### Software Analyst Intern

**Company:** Learn21

**Dates of Employment:** May 2022 - August 2022, January 2023 - May 2023, August 2023 - December 2023, May 2024 - August 2024

**Reason for Continued Co-op Rotations:**
I decided to complete all four of my co-op rotations with Learn21 due to the great opportunities for growth and development that the company provided. Each rotation allowed me to build upon my skills, take on increasingly complex challenges, and contribute meaningfully to projects that aligned with my career goals. Additionally, the company culture—characterized by collaboration, innovation, and support—resonated with my personal values and made each rotation a great experience.

### Technical Skills and Expertise:
During my internship, I developed a comprehensive skill set in full-stack development, with a particular emphasis on back-end technologies. My technical expertise includes:

- **.NET Framework and Entity Framework:** Played a role in the company’s transition from .NET 2 to .NET 6, where I was responsible for testing, debugging, and ensuring the stability of web applications throughout the upgrade. This involved identifying and resolving errors, which deepened my understanding of both legacy and modern .NET environments.

- **Back-End Development:** Worked extensively on back-end systems, including optimizing server-side logic, improving database interactions, and ensuring efficient data processing. My work in C# and SQL involved writing and optimizing queries, managing data integrity, and enhancing the performance of database-driven applications.

- **System Integration:** Contributed to integration projects where I worked on linking external web applications with the company’s core systems. This required synchronization of data and processes, as well as ensuring seamless communication between different software components. My involvement in these projects improved my skills in C#, and complex system architectures.

- **Front-End Development:** Led efforts to modernize the user interface of the company’s web applications, improving user experience and accessibility. My work involved refining layouts and implementing responsive designs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making the web applications more user-friendly and visually appealing.

- **Bug Fixing and Client Support:** Addressed numerous bugs and issues, both identified internally and reported by customers. My role in troubleshooting and resolving these issues enhanced my problem-solving skills and provided valuable experience in maintaining and improving existing codebases.

- **Database Management:** Conducted various database management tasks, including creating, updating, and optimizing SQL queries. My work ensured efficient data retrieval and manipulation, contributing to the overall performance and reliability of the company’s applications.

### Non-Technical Skills and Expertise:
In addition to my technical accomplishments, my internship experience also allowed me to develop key non-technical skills, including:

- **Project Management:** Successfully managed both individual and team projects, ranging from UI updates to back-end system integrations. This experience enhanced my ability to prioritize tasks, manage time effectively, and ensure project milestones were met on schedule.

- **Client Communication and Support:** Provided direct support to clients, assisting them with technical issues and addressing their concerns. This role improved my ability to communicate complex technical concepts in a clear and accessible manner, as well as strengthened my customer service skills.

- **Adaptability:** Engaged in a variety of tasks across front-end and back-end development, as well as system integrations. I approached each challenge with an open mind, learning and adapting to new tools and technologies to effectively support the projects I worked on.

- **Collaboration:** Worked closely with cross-functional teams, including developers, project managers, and client support personnel. My ability to collaborate effectively and contribute to team efforts was instrumental in the successful completion of various projects during my internship.

## Project Sought

I am seeking a capstone project that will allow me to build upon the skills I developed during my co-op experiences while also offering opportunities for growth in new areas. My previous work, which involved a blend of front-end and back-end development, system integration, and client support, has equipped me with a strong foundation in CS. I am particularly interested in projects that will allow me to utilize my existing knowledge, while also offering the opportunity to explore new areas through research and experimentation. I am open to tackling a range of challenges that extend my current skill set and introduce me to new technologies and approaches.

Ideally, the project will involve both independent problem-solving and collaboration with a team, allowing me to continue refining my technical skills and gain deeper insights into software architecture and user experience design. I’m looking for a project that enhances my current skills and helps me learn new ones, preparing me for future opportunities.
