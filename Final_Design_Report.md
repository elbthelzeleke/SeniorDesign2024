## 3. Test Plan and Results

### Test Methodology

Our testing strategy included both **manual testing** and **unit testing**, with a focus on ensuring the systemâ€™s functionality, accessibility, and robustness across different user profiles. We prioritized manual testing for front-end UI components and interaction flows, while unit testing was applied to core backend logic such as device toggling, routine scheduling, and settings configuration.

#### Manual Testing
- Performed on Chrome and Edge browsers
- Focused on UI responsiveness, accessibility features (large text, contrast mode), and voice integration toggles
- User scenarios tested: login, profile editing, toggling devices, creating/deleting routines

#### Unit Testing
- Backend components (e.g., device controller, routine handler)
- Simulated input/output using mock data
- Ensured valid state updates and consistent data storage behavior

### Key Takeaways
- Manual testing helped us uncover interaction edge cases not caught in unit tests.
- Testing with diverse user profiles highlighted UI flexibility strengths and prompted refinements (e.g., better alignment in large-text mode).
- We used GitHub Issues to track and resolve bugs collaboratively across backend and frontend components.

## 4. User Manual

### Overview

The user manual explains how to operate the smart home interface, including logging in, customizing preferences, managing devices, and setting up routines. I is included in the Git Hub

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
EG.
> **Q: What if a device doesn't respond?**  
**A:** The device will show an "offline" status. Please check your network connection or restart the smart device. The dashboard attempts auto-refresh every 30 seconds.
